# JavaScript Captcha Project

This project is built for Javascript Beginners.
This project is inspired by Indian Army Website Captcha. Whenever,we open Indian Army Website, they ask for a enter valid captcha. 
If you enter correct, it'll redirect you to official website.
If you don't, you need to write correct Captcha.
